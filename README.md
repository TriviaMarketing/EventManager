EventManager
============

A simple Javascript event manager that add events management to pure javascript classes/objects.

Event in javascript comes with DOM elements. However, it could be nice to have this event system in pure javascript
classes or objects. That's what does this library: make your classes or your objects "event aware". Then any of those
objects will be able to trigger events and to receive events.

Example
-------

Take a look at **test.html** for the tests.
